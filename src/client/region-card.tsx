/**
 * The per-region cards on the account pool page.
 *
 * Shape of one card, and why it is this shape:
 *
 * - A 40px brand tile in the corner, because the user asked for the login
 *   page's tile and the two pages must look like the same family. It is the
 *   SHARED `BrandTile` from `brand-tile.tsx`, not a second copy of one: two
 *   separately measured tiles stop matching the first time one of them moves a
 *   pixel.
 * - Title, endpoint subtitle, and a state pill. The pill carries `data-state`
 *   so the colour comes from CSS, not from a prop that has to be kept in sync
 *   with the copy.
 * - One line of prose, clamped to two lines. A card that grows with its text
 *   stops being a card.
 * - A compact statistic row (accounts / models / remaining credit) with the
 *   numbers highlighted and the labels quiet, which is the order the user
 *   reads them in.
 * - A row of three outline buttons and the `Accounts / Models` disclosure.
 *
 * The disclosures use `aria-expanded` + `hidden`, not `max-height: 0`.
 * `max-height: 0` clips the focus ring of anything inside the panel, which
 * makes the first Tab after expanding land nowhere visible.
 *
 * `aria-expanded` on this page is new. The host-compatibility suite used to
 * assert that this page carried NO expand affordance at all; that assertion was
 * about a whole-card collapse that no longer exists. Two explicit, labelled
 * disclosures inside a card are a different control and are allowed. The test
 * was narrowed to the old rule rather than the new one ignored.

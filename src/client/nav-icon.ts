/**
 * Nav glyph for the WorkBuddy XD Pool settings page.
 *
 * The host's settings shell draws its own 16px `svg` in every nav row and the
 * `settings.section` registration contract projects only `id` / `order` /
 * `label` — there is no `icon` field to pass. A third-party page therefore has
 * to mark its row in the DOM and mask this artwork over the shell's glyph, the
 * same technique `dshmarket` uses (`installSettingsNavIcon`).
 *
 * Kept as a single monochrome path so `mask-image` + `currentColor` can tint it
 * with whatever the active theme uses for nav text: a filled mask cannot carry
 * its own palette, and a two-tone icon would render as a flat silhouette.
 *

/**
 * The nav mark: a stack of three rounded "accounts" under a rotation arc.
 *
 * Reads as "a pool of accounts being cycled" at 16px, and — unlike a literal
 * droplet or cloud — stays legible when reduced to a single-color silhouette.
 * `fill-rule="evenodd"` cuts the interior notches out of the silhouette so the
 * three layers stay distinguishable at that size.

/**
 * The mark's geometry, independent of any wrapper element.

 * different frames: the settings nav row masks a standalone document, while the
 * sidebar panel row renders paths into an `svg` the shell sizes for it (16px
 * wide, 18px in the collapsed rail). Sharing the paths — rather than the whole
 * document, parsed back out with a regex — is what keeps the two placements from
 * drifting apart when the artwork changes.

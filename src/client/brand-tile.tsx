/**
 * The 40px brand tile shared by the login channels and the account-pool cards.
 *
 * The user asked for the account pool to look like the sign-in page, which
 * means the two need the SAME tile, not two tiles that were measured by eye and
 * happen to be 40px. So the tile lives here, once, and both pages render it.
 *
 * Four decisions worth stating, because each of them is a way this could have
 * looked wrong:
 *
 * 1. A channel with real artwork shows it (`icon`); a channel without one wears
 *    its OWN INITIALS on the gradient (`initials`). The fallback is not a
 *    degraded mode — five of the thirteen channels have no logo in any build we
 *    carry — so the tile has to be good in both shapes rather than treating one
 *    as the real thing. The initials are the point of decision 5 below.
 * 2. The glyph is a CSS `mask`, not a `background-image`. The tile's gradient
 *    is repainted on hover (the tile lifts and rotates). With a background
 *    image the browser repaints the glyph along with the gradient, which shows
 *    up as a flicker on a 16-40px target. A mask is a separate layer and does
 *    not.
 * 3. The gradient is built from `color-mix` on the accent, not from two stored
 *    stops. Each channel supplies exactly one colour — its own brand — and
 *    inventing a second stop per channel would be a guess dressed as a fact.
 * 4. There is no alt text: the tile is `aria-hidden` and decorative. The
 *    channel's real name is right next to it in the same row, so a tile that
 *    announced itself would make a screen reader say every channel name twice.
 * 5. The no-artwork fallback is INITIALS, not a generic glyph. This is the fix
 *    for the user reporting that LobsterAI, TRAE, Loomy, MiniMax Code and Gemini
 *    Code Assist "have no icon set": they were all wearing the same `login` key
 *    shape, so five different vendors were visually identical and read as
 *    broken. The reference build solves it the same way — its logo tile falls
 *    back to `channel.name.slice(0, 2).toUpperCase()`. Letters come from the
 *    vendor's own name, so a reader can tell the five apart at a glance without
 *    anyone sourcing artwork we do not have, and nothing in the tile claims to
 *    be a logo it is not. The `login`/`chat`/`globe` glyphs stay for the two
 *    lanes that are not vendors at all — a pool card is a lane, not a company.

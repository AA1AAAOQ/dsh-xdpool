/**
 * The CodeArts resign headers the signed-request gateway wants.
 *
 * CodeArts signs every chat completion with SDK-HMAC-SHA256, and the signature
 * covers the request BODY. billion-context sits in front of it inside DSH and
 * compresses context, which necessarily rewrites the body — and a rewritten body
 * invalidates the signature. bili has no credential for this scheme, so it takes
 * its `compress-or-refuse` exit and answers the request locally with
 * `403 {"code":"bili_resign_unavailable"}`. The pack only sees a 403, and
 * `httpErrorCode()` maps every 403 to `AUTH`, so it surfaces as "API 密钥无效"
 * even though the credential is perfectly valid.
 *
 * Handing bili the three signing inputs lets it re-sign after compressing, which
 * is what keeps the link compressed.
 *
 * Two things are pinned here that are easy to get wrong:
 *
 * 1. The headers must be set AFTER `signRequestHuawei` and BEFORE the fetch. The
 *    Huawei signature is computed over a fixed header set that does not include
 *    them, so adding them earlier would either be overwritten by the signed map
 *    or (worse) silently change what gets signed.
 * 2. They are OFF unless explicitly enabled. billion-context is an
 *    `optionalDependency`: when it is absent these headers reach the upstream
 *    verbatim, with `secret_access_key` inside (base64, trivially decodable).
 *    bili does strip both headers and re-sign with its own credential when it is
 *    present — verified against a local echo upstream — but the switch must not
 *    depend on that, and bili's in-process native client builds its own
 *    `resignExtra` regardless of what the pack sends.
 *
 * `pack.js` is a build artifact of another repository (`vendor/channel-pack/src`
 * is not even tracked here), so it cannot be imported and driven; a source
 * assertion is the only check that survives the next pack refresh. It fails
 * loudly if a pack update drops the patch — the same shape as the 11128
 * coverage assertions in `tests/chat-identity-headers.test.ts`.

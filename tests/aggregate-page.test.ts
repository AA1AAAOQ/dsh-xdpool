/**
 * The aggregate roster's contract.
 *
 * Nothing else guards this page. `region-card-layout.test.ts` covers the pool
 * cards, `card-shell.test.ts` covers the shell, and the aggregate sheet had no
 * equivalent — which is how two rows of it could grow class names that no rule
 * ever defined (silently unstyled, which in a screenshot looks like a design
 * choice), and how the whole roster could open with its key fields already on
 * screen and every switch already flipped.
 *
 * The user's asks, in the order they made them:
 *
 *   1. counts in the filter buttons' own parentheses;
 *   2. the roster laid out like the sign-in page — one compact card per vendor;
 *   3. a line of small print explaining the vendor;
 *   4. the API key field appearing only when the row is opened;
 *   5. and nothing enabled until the user asks for it.
 *
 * The last one is a backend behaviour, so it is locked in `aggregate-page.test.ts`
 * too rather than being taken on trust from the markup.

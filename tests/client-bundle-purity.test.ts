/**
 * The client bundle runs in a browser, where `process` does not exist.
 *
 * A bare `process.env.X` anywhere in it is a `ReferenceError` at module
 * evaluation time — not at call time — so the whole client half of the plugin
 * fails to import and the shell's boot audit reports the entry as
 * "import failed (see console for the import error)". That is exactly what
 * shipped once: a server-only `process.env.XDPOOL_FREE_BASE` survived into
 * `lib/client.js`, the browser threw on the first line of the factory, and the
 * app came up in recovery mode with no diagnostic that named the cause.
 *
 * The guard is cheap and the failure is total, so the rule is absolute: every
 * `process.<member>` read in the browser bundle has to sit on a line that also
 * tests `typeof process`. A comment mentioning "process." is fine — the match
 * requires an identifier after the dot.
 *
 * This reads the built artifact, not the source, because that is the thing that
 * actually ships: the source can be correct and the bundle still wrong when a
 * server-only module is pulled into the client graph.
